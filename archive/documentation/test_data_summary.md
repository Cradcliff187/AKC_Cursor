# Supabase Test Data Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the test data that has been inserted into the Supabase database. The test data was created using the `insert_all_test_data.py` script, which inserts sample records into all tables in the database.

## Tables with Test Data

The following tables now have test data:

1. **user_profiles**: User account information
2. **clients**: Client company information
3. **projects**: Project details linked to clients
4. **project_tasks**: Tasks associated with projects
5. **tasks**: General tasks (for time entries)
6. **invoices**: Invoices for projects
7. **invoice_items**: Line items for invoices
8. **payments**: Payment records for invoices
9. **user_notifications**: Notifications for users
10. **bids**: Bid proposals for projects
11. **bid_items**: Line items for bids
12. **expenses**: Project expenses
13. **time_entries**: Time tracking records
14. **documents**: Project documents

## Data Relationships

The test data maintains proper relationships between tables:

- Each project is linked to a client
- Project tasks are linked to projects
- Invoices are linked to projects and clients
- Invoice items are linked to invoices
- Payments are linked to invoices
- Bids are linked to projects and clients
- Bid items are linked to bids
- Expenses are linked to projects
- Time entries are linked to projects and tasks
- Documents are linked to projects

## Schema Insights

During the test data insertion process, we discovered several important details about the database schema:

1. The `invoices` table requires `subtotal`, `total_amount`, and `balance_due` fields
2. The `bid_items` table requires `quantity` and `amount` fields
3. The `invoice_items` table requires `quantity` and `amount` fields
4. The `documents` table requires a `storage_path` field
5. The `tasks` table is separate from the `project_tasks` table
6. The `time_entries` table references the `tasks` table, not the `project_tasks` table

## Next Steps

Now that test data has been inserted into the database, you can:

1. **Test the Application**: Run the application and verify that it can retrieve and display the test data correctly.
2. **Deploy to Google Cloud**: Follow the deployment instructions to deploy the application to Google Cloud.
3. **Set Up Environment Variables**: Configure the necessary environment variables in Google Cloud.
4. **Test the Deployed Application**: Verify that the deployed application can connect to the Supabase database and access the test data.

## Maintenance

To add more test data or reset the database:

1. Run the `insert_all_test_data.py` script again to add more test data.
2. If you need to delete test data, you can use the Supabase dashboard to delete records or write a script to delete the test data.
3. To modify the test data, edit the `insert_all_test_data.py` script and run it again.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the test data:

1. Check the Supabase dashboard to verify that the data was inserted correctly.
2. Run the `check_table_schema.py` script to verify the schema of the tables.
3. Check the application logs for any errors related to database access.
4. Verify that the environment variables are set correctly.
